# JCache Example using Infinispan

Example using the `CacheResult` annotation from [JCache](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=107) bound to the implementation from [Infinispan](http://infinispan.org) and _configure it_.

This runs on JBoss 7 with Java 7.

Took me a while to it figure out. Now that it works, I leave it here as an example and starting point.
